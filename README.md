# System-Administration
Bash scripts to automate the tasks and understand the system better

Always make sure to check the permissions of the script when executing. 
Without making the script executable, it would give you an error and would not run. 

Execution Permissions:

To make your .sh files executable ,use:-

 `chmod +x your_script_name.sh`
 

To make the script readable, writable, and executable by everyone, use:


`chmod 777 your_script_name.sh`


**Caution**: It's generally not recommended to use the chmod 777 command, as it grants full permissions to everyone, potentially exposing the file to vulnerabilities.

To run the script:-

`./ your_script_name.sh`

or 

`bash your_script_name.sh`
